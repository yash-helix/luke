    "Options": ['Commission', 'Transparent', 'Insert', 'Stereotype', 'Duty'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: 'Commission' is a payment for a service. 'Transparent' is when something is seen through. 'Stereotype' is a fixed idea about a particular type of thing or person. 'Duty' is when one is a legal obligation to do something. And 'insert' is when you put something into something else. This is the opposite of 'eject' which is to take something out of something else.

    "Options": ['walk, branch', 'snap, smile', 'hammer, criticism', 'traverse, breeze', 'cross, labour'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: For the first missing word, we need a word that is an action to the bridge. Snap does not work. The words from the options that work properly are: walk, traverse, cross and even hammer, although it is a little odd. The second missing word needs context. The passage states that the workers will earn more for something. We have branch, that doesn't make much sense. Neither does breeze. Smile, criticism and labour work. Smile is paired with snap does that is no longer an option. Indolence suggests being lazy, and labour is an antonym of this. Given the context therefore, labour makes good sense rather than criticism which is a little peculiar in the circumstance. Therefore, the correct word pair is: cross, labour.",

    "Options": ['obligated', 'defended', 'exceeded', 'waited', 'copied'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a verb as the subject is enabled to stay in their house for months. 'Defended' to stay doesn't make much sense, neither does 'exceeded to stay'. Waited to stay is awkward and bizarre. Copied to say doesn't make sense either. 'Obligated' to stay makes sense grammatic and in the context of the sentence. The person had to stay in their house. Therefore, it is the correct answer.",

    "Options": ['conversation, outside', 'collection, outer', 'guarantee, high', 'meeting, zone', 'gathering, far'],

    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word to describe a group of reefs. We have first options for the first word: conversation, collection, guarantee, meeting, gathering. Conversation does not work here, and guarantee is a little awkward so they can be disregarded. The other three words all work so they are all possible answers for now. The second word is a preceding word combined with space. From our three options, we have: outer, zone and far. Zone does not work at all. Far works but makes little sense. Outer makes sense and works in this situation. Therefore, the correct answer is: collection, outer.",

    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word that fits with its preceding sentence and context of a hike in thick foliage and intertwined vines. 'Racy' and 'edible' do not make much sense. A hike being 'nearly likely' is very odd given the context so this answer is most unlikely. 'Nearly straightforward' could work but seems contradictory to the realities of thick foliage and intertwined vines - things that would typically make a hike more challenging. 'Nearly impossible' therefore seems to describe what would be the case in this context. As a result, it is the correct answer.",

'Folklore' is the tales, stories and shared ideas that a group of people have locally. 'Display' is in fact a synonym of 'show' rather than an opposite or near opposite.

    "Solution": "Explanation: This one is all about a small extension of the subsequent subject. As you can see, cup is not an extension of coaster, they are separate objects. Lifting a dumbbell is not relevant. Jacket to sleeve is the wrong way around. Again, TV and remote are not connected. Leaf to branch is the similar example. Therefore, that is the correct answer.",

Therefore, we should expect is to be on the right side. The orange square does the same thing as the green hexagon. We should therefore expect it in the top left corner. The blue triangle is moving from corner to corner in an anti-clockwise motion. We should therefore expect it to be in the bottom right hand corner. The only answer that fits this pattern is C.",
