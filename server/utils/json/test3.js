    "Solution": "Explanation: Notice that the first letter in the pair goes A, B then C. We can gather from this that it is moving in alphabetical order. Therefore, we can surmise that the next first letter will be D. The second letter in the pair goes M, N, then O. We can gather from this that is also moving alphabetically, from the midway point of the alphabet. Therefore, we can surmise that the next second letter will be P. As a result, we can determine that the next letter pair will be DP.",

    "Options": ['Yellow is to television', 'Green is to leaf', 'Orange is to water', 'Red is to aubergine', 'Purple is to tangerine'],

    "Solution": "Explanation: The answer is that the noun is the same colour their pairing colour.  For example, orange is to water, and red is to aubergine, are not the same. The one that is the same is green is to leaf. Hence, that is the correct answer. Q3 Choose the word that is opposite, or almost opposite to the word: TIDY (A) Messy (B) Mile (C) Twist (D) Shelter (E) Small Explanation: Mile and twist do not make much sense. Shelter likewise doesn't relate to being an opposite to tidy. Small would be a synonym of 'tiny' not tidy. Do not get tricked by reading the wrong word - and either way, it is a synonym and an opposite. Messy however is when something is not tidy. Therefore, it is an opposite of tidy and as a result, it is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: For the first missing word, we need a word that is an action to the tables, suggesting that they are close to each other. The words from the options that work properly are: Stacked, pushed, and perhaps leaned although it is a little odd. The second missing word precedes 'items' and describes what items they are. The words from the options that work properly are potentially all of them, though some are more awkward than others. The most typical word is 'personal'. And since personal is paired with pushed, another word that works well with the previous missing word, this is the best word pair we have. Therefore, the correct word pair is: pushed, personal.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word describing what everyone was already like. Given the nature of the passage and the fact that a new hire is there to help reduce workload, context is important. 'Acquitted' doesn't make much sense, neither does 'unready'. 'Invisible' works grammatically but does not make much sense in the overall context. 'Imagining' also doesn't really work.

    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word to describe the quantity of rainwater. We have five options for the first word: measure, amount, level, difficulty, ability. Ability does not work here, and difficulty is a little awkward so they can be disregarded. The other three words all work so they are all possible answers for now. The second word is saying what happened due to the rainwater. From our three options, we have: boomed, ruined and suntanned. Suntanned does not work at all. Boomed also makes little sense. Ruined makes sense and works in this situation. Therefore, the correct answer is: Amount, ruined.",

If we count the blue, we have 3 / 12 squares + 2 half squares, thus 4 / 12 squares. If we count the black squares we have 4 squares + 4 half squares = 6 whole squares.

Hard works but It's a little awkward as it doesn't quite make sense in the rest of the context, but it works. Confusing works well and makes sense in the context, as does provocative. Diagram doesn't quite work. For our second missing word we have: subject, light, topic, shareholder and guideline. Light, shareholder and guideline do not make sense. Topic makes sense but its preceding word in the pair does not so this is not the answer. Subject works well and make sense in the context and the preceding word in the pair works.

Nimble would be a synonym of 'agile' rather than an opposite or almost opposite. Do not get tricked by thinking you require a synonym rather than an antonym. Stiff however is when something is not agile. Therefore, it is an opposite or almost opposite of agile and as a result, it is the correct answer.",

First at the bottom, next on the left and bottom, and finally on top, left and bottom. Therefore, we are looking for a hexagon with three semi-circle holes, top, left and bottom. From our answer options we can see that H fits this description. As a result, it is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Solution: We can notice that 1 to 100 is x100 and then goes to 50. That is divided by 2. If the pattern were to continue, then we should x100 again getting to 5000. If we then divide by 2 we get the final in the sequence, 2500. Therefore, 5000 works. We can deduce we have correctly solved the sequence.",

    "Options": ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    "Images": ['Test3_image_Page43_1.png'],
    "Solution": "Explanation: We have two shapes, an outer green hexagon and an inner purple hexagon, with two arrows. These arrows start and end in different corners. In the pattern, we can see that the arrows move places. Focusing on the outer arrow, we can see it moves corner by corner anti-clockwise, in both its starting and ending position. Focusing on the inner arrow, we can see it moves corner by corner clockwise, starting and ending one more corner over from within the pentagon. Therefore, we can surmise that the next in the pattern will need the arrow in the top left pointing downwards left inside the pentagon. And the outer arrow will be starting in the top corner of the pentagon ending in the right corner of the hexagon. Thus, B is the correct answer.",

    "Question": "It takes Roshni 40 minutes to jog from home to the park at an average pace of 6mph. Her gym is another 20 minutes jog from the park. How far away is the gym from her home?",
    "Options": ['2 miles', '4 miles', '6 miles', '8 miles', '10 miles'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Step 1: A pace of 6 mph means that Roshni will therefore jog 6 miles in 60 minutes. d = s * t Step 2: 40 minutes is 2/3 of 60 minutes, therefore she has moved 4 miles. Another 20 minutes at the same pace, 1/3 of 60 minutes, is 2 miles. 4 + 2 = 6",

    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: Boulder is to stone. It is the same category of object but one is larger or grander than the other. With knife is to fork, we have different objects. That is also true for pencil is to pen and cup is to mug. Forest is to trees, they are similar categories but not quite the same. Ocean is to lake is a similar conceptual idea and therefore is the right answer.",

    "Options": ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    "Images": ['Test3_image_Page47_1.png'],
    "Solution": "Explanation: This question is a little harder than the previous scale questions we have faced. The first suggests that one blue triangle (BT) = one orange square (OS). The next suggests that this, combined with a green hexagon (GH) is = to 1 purple star (PS). C tells us that GH = 2BT = 2OS. D confirms the logic of A, which suggests therefore that D is also balanced. E states that PS =OS + BT = 2BT/2OS. This is different from B. The other scales confirm the logic of B rather than E, and as a result, E is the scale which is not balanced.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: We can notice that there are two rows of shapes. The top is filled with 2 orange squares and 1 purple star. The bottom is filled with 2 green octagon and 1 blue triangle. The focus is on the single shapes on each row, namely, the star and the triangle. We can notice that wherever the triangle is located in the column, or in other words, where it is pointing, is the location that the star is going to be in the next pattern in the sequence. As a result, pattern 5 shows the triangle in the right-hand column, so we need an answer where the star is in the right-hand column. Only answer option has this available. Therefore, it is the correct answer.",
