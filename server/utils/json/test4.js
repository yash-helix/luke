    "Options": ['BD', 'CB', 'CC', 'CD', 'DD'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: Notice that the first letter in the pair goes A, A, B then B. It is not immediately obvious the pattern here. The second letter in the pair goes A, B, B, C. Again, not straightforward. But seen as pairs in a continuous sequence, we can see that the pairs are shifting alphabetically, as if down a line. The right-hand move to the left-hand. The letters are moving left down the sequence. Therefore, we can surmise that the C on the right-hand side will shift left, meaning our left-hand letter will be C. And given there are 3 As and 3 Bs, we should expect 3Cs. We have only seen one so the next will in the sequence will be a C. Therefore, the right-hand letter of the pair will also be a C. As a result, we can determine that the next letter pair will be CC.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: For our first missing word we have: documentaries, novels, fashion, washing and sayings. The word needs to work with provocative. Almost all the words work except washing. For our second missing word we have: glow, retire, bend, foster and attack. Attack, bend and glow do not make sense. This leaves us only with foster and retire. Both of them work within the context of the sentence. But foster is paired with 'washing' the previous word that did not make sense.

We can see that in the left hand column, the lines are on the right and in the right hand column, the lines are on the left and in the middle, in the middle. Following this logic, the same is true for the other arrow and the rows. As a result, the answer which is in the bottom right corner will have an arrow on the left, for being in the right hand column, and an arrow on the bottom for being in the bottom row. The answer that contains these arrow is option F which is therefore the correct answer.",

The wind breezed them with full force is odd. Full force suggests impact. The wind curled them with full force is also awkward. The wind picked them with full force also doesn't make much sense. The wind hit them with full force works well and makes sense in the context as 'hit' suggests impact. Therefore, hit is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: We have two shapes, an outer green hexagon and an inner purple pentagon, with two arrows. These arrows start and end in different corners. In the pattern, we can see that the arrows move places. Focusing on the first arrow, we can see its head is always focused at the top corner of the inner purple pentagon. The starting place of the arrow shifts clockwise to the next inner corner of the green hexagon. Therefore, we would expect the arrow to start in the bottom left corner of the hexagon, and ending at the top corner of the pentagon. The second arrow starts at the bottom left inner corner of the hexagon ending at the opposite pentagon corner. The arrow moves clockwise, corner by corner, one by one. We should therefore expect the next arrow to start and end one corner over. Since the inner shape is a pentagon and the outer a hexagon, the excess corner of the hexagon will change the uniformity of the arrow. This arrow should get longer and the corners will get further and further apart as it continues to rotate. Therefore, we would expect the arrow to start in the top right inner corner of the hexagon and end at the right corner of the pentagon. Option D has the arrows in both of these positions.

Following this, this means our answer will have a white circle on the bottom. If we follow the blue lines, we see they simply move up and down from bottom, middle, top, back to middle. Therefore, our answer will have blue lines in the middle. And finally, if we follow the orange square, it moves to the corners clockwise.

    "Solution": "Explanation: The first pair is the same. The second pair has a difference in the middle. 3S3 / 33S The third pair is the same. The fourth pair has a difference at the end. 455 / 545 The fifth pair has a difference in the middle. 15j / 15i Therefore, there are 2 pairs that are exact duplicates.",

    "Question": "Choose the word that is opposite, or almost opposite to the word: PROMOTE",
    "Options": ['Entertain', 'Clarify', 'Expose', 'Change', 'Obstruct'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: To promote is to express or avidly bring more attention to something. 'Entertain' is to give or put on a show to someone, so this is not an opposite or almost opposite. 'Clarify' to make something more clear to someone. 'Expose' is to show something that has been concealed. 'Change' is to alter something. 'Obstruct' is to not show something or to stop something from being shown. This is the opposite or what is happening when someone is promoting something. It is not an exact opposite, but is an almost opposite. Therefore, obstruct is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: Each box contains 5 shapes. A circle, a square, a triangle, a pentagon and a hexagon. They are randomly scattered around. However, box B does not contain a pentagon but instead has 2 hexagons. Therefore, it is the odd one out.",

    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: This one is all about synonyms. As you can see, wave is to ride is not synonymous but rather an action to do to the wave. Exercise is to sweat, a consequence of the action. Work is to busy, an effect of the action. Single is to lonely is likewise an effect of the state. Linger is to remain is a synonym, like finish is to complete. Therefore, E is the correct answer.",

    "Options": ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    "Images": ['Test4_image_Page44_1.png'],
    "Solution": "Explanation: We have four shapes, each compartmentalised into a corner in the box. A purple star, an orange square, a green hexagon, and a blue triangle. Looking at the blue triangle, we see that it is always in the bottom left corner, but it rotates every next box in the sequence by 90 degrees anti-clockwise. The other shapes move from corner to corner. If we look at any one shape, we see that they are moving anticlockwise between the remaining three corners. In fact, they move uniformly anticlockwise, thus making their positions predictable. As a result, we require: the top left corner to contain the green hexagon, the top right corner to contain the purple star, the bottom left corner to contain the orange square and the bottom right corner to contain the blue triangle pointing to the left. Therefore, the answer is B - that contains all of those elements.",

    "Options": ['QX', 'PR', 'PT', 'ST', 'QR'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: Notice that the first letter in the pair goes T, S then R. We can gather from this that it is moving in alphabetical order backwards. Therefore, we can surmise that the next first letter will be Q. The second letter in the pair goes X, T, then S. If we look at the pairs, we can gather from this that the subsequent right hand letter was the previous left hand letter. For example, TX = ST. WE can surmise that the next second letter will be R. As a result, we can determine that the next letter pair will be QR.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: Each box contains a square, a hexagon and a triangle. This does not change. The order of the shapes does change alternately. Of the three shapes, one is shaded with its respective colour and the other two are empty white. However, E contains two shapes that are shaded in and only one that is empty white. Therefore, it is the odd one out.",

    "Options": ['Left', 'Centre', 'Right'],
    "Images": ['Test4_image_Page47_1.png'],
    "Solution": "Step 1: Each box must contain at least three objects. The ladle and spatula are in the left box. Step 2: The bell and battery are in the right box, which is the same box that contains the pinecone. Therefore, the right box has three objects and can be discounted. Step 3: The egg and bucket are in the box next to the ladle, so the middle. And the carton is next to the one with the spatula, the left, so It's also in the middle. Therefore, the middle box has three objects also. The only box without three objects is the left box, which will therefore accept the ninth object, a pillow.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: The second states that it rains on Wednesdays, and the third that it is sunny on Tuesday. The first statement is that George walks home on both Tuesdays and Wednesday. Thus, the statement that when George will walk home in the rain is neither true nor false because it depends on the day. Therefore, the answer is cannot say.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: The first statement says that the office requires new paper. The second statement says that stationary items include scissors and pens but there is no mention of paper. The conclusion that the office requires new stationary is neither true nor false because while we know the office requires new paper, we do not know whether it requires any new scissors or pens.

    "Question": "Each scale is balanced except for one. Which scale is not balanced?",
    "Options": ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E'],
    "Images": ['Test4_image_Page50_1.png'],
    "Solution": "Explanation: This question is a little harder than the previous scale questions we have faced. The first suggests that 2 orange squares (OS) = one green hexagon (GH). The third suggests that likewise 2 blue triangles (BT) = one green hexagon. To confirm whether these are both true or one of them false, we have D which states that 2OS = 2BT. This seems to confirm that logic. E states that OS+BT = one purple star (PS). And B, that PS = GH+BT. Given that GH = 2BT, this would mean that PS = 3BT which is NOT the same as E, or the rules established in A, C and D. Therefore, this is the unbalanced scale and as such the correct answer is B.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: If we look at the top row, we can see two lines, then another two lines and then a complete square. This suggests a composite, but the other rows will show us this is not the case. In the middle row, we have two lines, bottom left and right diagonal, the middle box three lines, bottom left, top left and top right lines, and the right box we have top left, top right and bottom right lines. This means, that across the row each line is represented twice. That rule is also true for the top row and therefore will be for the bottom in order to find our answer. So in the our bottom row left we have two lines, top left and bottom left diagonal. The middle we have three lines, top right, bottom right and bottom left. Therefore in order to have the",
