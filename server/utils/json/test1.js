    "Question": "He quietly ________ the theatre as the performance started.",
    "Options": ['entered', 'reminded', 'drank', 'proceeded', 'yielded'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a verb as the subject does something to the theatre. 'Reminded' the theatre makes sense but is a very unusual action that seems odd and unlikely. Yielded and proceeded do not make much sense. Drank the theatre also does not make much sense. 'Entered' the theatre works and makes sense in the context of the situation the sentence conjures. Therefore, it is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word that fits with its preceding word 'too'. Of the options: 'never be too often cherries' doesn't make much grammatical sense. Too bite, and too rich also don't make much sense. There can never be too small cherries is also very peculiar. Too many cherries works here and therefore is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: Notice that the first letter in the pair goes A, B then C. We can gather from this that it is moving in alphabetical order. Therefore, we can surmise that the next first letter will be D. The second letter in the pair goes Z, Y, X. This is going alphabetically backwards. Therefore, we can surmise that the next second letter will be W. As a result, the next letter pair is DW.",

Safety media is not an expression commonly used if at all, as well as safety signatures. The only word that makes sense here is safety 'measures'. Therefore, it is the correct answer.",

    "Options": ['Brood', 'Variation', 'Form', 'Conscience', 'Heed'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: Disregard is when you do not care about what is taking place. To 'brood' is to sulk, and take stock of your feelings in a negative manner. 'Variation' is another type of something. 'Form' is the shape a concept might take. 'Conscience' is your thinking process and mind. 'Heed' is to pay attention or notice something.

    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: For our first missing word we have: important, demonstrable, required, ideal and measured. Measured doesn't quite work. Demonstrable is possible but is awkward. Important, required and ideal all work in context. It is hard to determine which is best so far. For our second missing word we have: offer, drastic, extort, store and give. Store, drastic and extort do not make sense. Offer and give make sense in context. However, the paired word with 'give' is 'measured' which does not work. Therefore, the only pair that works is 'important, offer'.",

    "Options": ['open, read', 'stun, protested', 'exclude, fair', 'commemorate, socialist', 'unveil, popular'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: For the first missing word, we need a word that stated that the new exhibition is being opened or built. The words from the options that work properly are: open, commemorate and unveil. The second missing word needs context. The passage states that the ticket numbers are high, and therefore this doesn't suggest the exhibition will be fair, protested, read, or indeed socialist. The word that works most here is popular. And popular is paired with unveil which is one of the other missing words that works. Therefore, the correct word pair is: unveil, popular.",

    "Options": ['beneath, increasingly', 'mark, action', 'thick, quite', 'under, review', 'below, applicably'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Explanation: The sentence requires a word to describe going under the ice. We have first options for the first word: beneath, mark, thick, under, below. Mark and thick do not work here so they can be disregarded. The other three words all work so they are all possible answers for now. The second word is an adverb and combined with 'difficult'. From our three options, we have: increasingly, review and applicably. Review does not work at all. Applicably works but makes little sense. Increasingly makes sense and works in this situation.

    "Solution": "Explanation: 'Miserable' is if one is unhappy. 'Negligence' is when one has been careless. 'Extension' is when something has got longer. 'Observable' is in fact a synonym of visible rather than an opposite or near opposite. And 'concealed' is when something is not visible. Therefore, it is an opposite or almost opposite.",

'Absolute' is singular, an authority, etc. 'Anticipation' is when one is eager for something to be.

If we focus on the blue triangle, we can see that it is moving around the hexagon one corner at a time in a clockwise manner. Therefore, the subsequent triangle in the pattern should be in the bottom right hand corner of the hexagon. If we focus on the orange square, we can see that it is moving around the hexagon two corners at a time in a clockwise manner.

Starting with the green hexagon in the front, the orange square just behind and the blue triangle at the back. The blue triangle then jumps to the front. Then the orange square, back to the green hexagon and repeat. The next one in the pattern needs to have the orange square jumping to the front. The only answer option that does this is B, therefore it is the correct answer.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: We are told that some gamers don't have jobs and that no adults are gamers. We are asked if we can conclude that some adults don't have jobs from these assumptions. Given that no adults are gamers, the previous assumption gamers have no bearing on adults. Therefore, the conclusion about some adults not having jobs cannot be determined either way. Therefore, it is cannot say.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: We can notice that 5 is 3 + 2. We do not know the middle number. It goes? then 13. After that is 21, which is 13 + 8. 8 is also 5 + 3, the first two in the sequence. If we try with 8, we find that 5 + 8 = 13. We can know reasonably say that the sequence is as follows. The current number + the previous number = the subsequent number. Therefore, the ? is 8.",

    "Solution": "Explanation: The first pair is the same. The second pair is the same. The third pair has a difference in the middle. 68x90 / 69x80 The fourth pair has a difference at the end. QRP / QPR The fifth pair is the same. Therefore, there are 3 pairs that are exact duplicates.",

    "Question": "It takes Ellie 45 minutes to walk from Home to Gym at a constant pace of 2mph. Ellie wants to reduce this time to 30 minutes. How much faster must Ellie walk?",
    "Options": ['0 mph', '0.5 mph', '1 mph', '1.5 mph', '2 mph'],
    "Images": [],
    "Solution": "Step 1: A pace of 2mph means that Ellie will therefore walk 1.5 miles in 45 minutes. S = d / t Step 2: S = 1.5 / 0.50 S = 3 Step 3: 3 - 2 = 1 Ellie therefore needs to increase her speed to 3mph, and thus must walk 1mph faster.",
